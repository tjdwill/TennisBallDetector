In this folder, I place code that serve as tests/prototypes of various features and subsystems of the project. For a given feature, my goal was to develop a working prototype in my testing environment (laptop in this case) before integrating the feature into the actual robot platform. Doing so helped separate problems with the logic governing the feature itself from problems with environment integration.
