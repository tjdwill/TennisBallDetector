# ROS Scripts

In this subdirectory, I upload the scripts for the ROS portion of the project. 
The project is "ROS-ified" by segmenting the program into nodes. 
For example, one node may capture images via the robot camera, and publish those photos to a topic. 
Another node would then subscribe to this topic, receive the images, and run the relevant processing to detect tennis balls.
